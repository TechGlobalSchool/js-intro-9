# Big O Introduction

## Efficiency

- Fewer Steps = Faster Code
- More Steps = Slower Code

## Time

- Time can not be used to measure efficiency
- It is unstable and dependent on environment

## Time complexity

Time complexity is the rate at which algorithm slows as input grows.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity of an algorithm or a data structure is the amount of
memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a
function of characteristics of the input.

## Big O Notation
Big O Notation lets us describe how running time scales when we increase the
input size (n)

- Constant O(1)
- Linear O(n)
 - Quadratic O(n^2)
 - Logarithmic O(logn)


 # Recursion
 - When function calls itself
 - Pros: Reduces complexity
 - Cons: Increases heap memory
 - Base case
 - Every recusrive function call must lead to base case
